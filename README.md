# RaspTop OS - OS for Raspberry Pi and PC

RaspTop OS is a OS for Raspberry Pi and PC. It's focused and well-tested on the Raspberry Pi.

It's tested on PC, but not as well-tested as the Pi. On the Pi it's tested on Raspbian Stretch (Lite). In the future there's a image you can flash for the Pi.

## Upgrading from old 0.5

There are different version of 0.5, the upgrade process is as following: update your OS and copy install.sh source code into install.sh on your storage disk. chmod +x install.sh and run it. Enjoy!

## A note about 0.6...

If you're upgrading from v0.6 to v0.7, you only need to install php. Run the following command:

*sudo apt install php -y*

Then you can normally update the os on the web interface (Settings -> Update Manager -> Update OS).

***That's it!***

## Web Interface login credentials

***No panic! Here are the credentials:***
