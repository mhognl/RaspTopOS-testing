## THIS IS THE TESTING DISTRIBUTION!
# RaspTop OS - OS for Raspberry Pi and PC

RaspTop OS is a OS for Raspberry Pi and PC. It's focused and well-tested on the Raspberry Pi.

It's tested on PC, but not as well-tested as the Pi. On the Pi it's tested on Raspbian Stretch (Lite). In the future there's a image you can flash for the Pi.

## Installing

To install the OS, run the following command:

wget https://github.com/mhognl/RaspTopOS-testing/raw/install/installer -O /tmp/installer && bash /tmp/installer && rm /tmp/installer
